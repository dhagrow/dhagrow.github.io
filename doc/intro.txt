This blog and it's inaugural series were born of my desire to explore new
frontiers.

For the past several years I have worked almost exclusively in Python and the
client-side web languages (Javascript/HTML/CSS). Occasionally, I've had
time to dig deeply into some C/C++, and go on small excursions with various
common scripting languages (Bash, Ruby, etc...).

I love Python, and it's easily my most productive language, but I feel like
I've stretched it beyond it's limits on several fronts.

This series will focus on the implementation of a web crawler (aka. spider) in
various languages. With each language I will take the implementation through
a number of stages which I hope will provide a reasonable survey of their
capabilities.

I begin with: Erlang.
